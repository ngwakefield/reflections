When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When it's likely that multiple people will update the repository, or if you will do it from multiple sources.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If it stays up to date automatically, then there could be lots of changes that you aren't aware of.  So when you go back to work on your local activity, it may have changed!
